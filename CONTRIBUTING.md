##Documentation contributions
If you want to contribute to cmdlet documentation, please do not make a pull request to modify the actual files in the Documentation folder itself. Those files
are automatically generated based upon comments in the actual classes. So if you want to modify documentation and or add an example of a cmdlet, navigate to the
corresponding class where the cmdlet is being implemented and add the comments there. An example can for instance be found in

https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/blob/dev/Commands/Fields/AddField.cs

Notice the [CmdletHelp("")] and [CmdletExample()] class attributes that describe the cmdlet.

##Cmdlet contributions

A few notes:
* Every new cmdlet should provide help and examples. 
* Most cmdlets will extend SPOWebCmdlet which provides a few helper objects for you to use. 
* Cmdlets will have to work both on-premises and in the cloud. You can use compiler directives (CLIENTSDKV15 and CLIENTSDKV16) to buFolffild different cmdlets for the different targets.
* The verb of a cmdlet (get-, add-, etc.) should follow acceptable cmdlet standards and should be part of one of the built in verbs classes (VerbsCommon, VerbsData, etc.)
